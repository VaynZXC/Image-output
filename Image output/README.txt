Working with localStorage and a third-party API. There are 3 types of use in that project. 1 - A number is entered and according to which number is entered,
 the number of pictures is displayed. 2 - Enter 2 numbers, each of which should be from 100-300. After that, a picture is displayed with the size of the
 sides that were set earlier. 3 - enter 2 numbers from 1-10. The first number indicates a page of images from the source site, and the second number indicates
 the number of images displayed from this page. In this example, localStorage is involved. When the site is reloaded, the pictures remain the same as they
 were last time. In addition to the request button, there is also a storage reset button.
